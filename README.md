## Key Objectives:

The main objectives of the project are as follows:
Regional Sales Analysis: Analyze sales data to understand the performance of each region in terms of sales amount.
Discount Impact Assessment: Assess the impact of discounts on sales and identify regions where discounts have the most influence on revenue.

## Data Processing:

Data Import: Import the sales dataset into Microsoft Excel.
Data Cleaning: Check for and address any missing values, errors, or inconsistencies in the dataset.
Data Transformation: Create calculated columns if necessary, such as the net sales amount after applying discounts.
